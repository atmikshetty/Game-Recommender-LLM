Welcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.

From your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!

Can you survive five nights at Freddy's?

Demon hunter is an action-packed dark fantasy hack and slash game with an incredible combat system and awesome boss fights, assisted by a one of a kind character control mechanism and a perfect mix of RPG elements to make your adventure super immersive.

A DARKENED, RUINED AND FULL OF SUFFERING SHADOW WORLD

As the mortal world got invaded and destroyed by the horde of dark demons and shadow monsters, everything was covered in the darkness of hell and the constant insufferable noises that were the combination of the endless scream from those evils and the crying and mourning of the lucky few that manage to survive through this nightmare.

The player  will be a  Hunter in this world, which is someone who got blessed by the Ancient One with a special power to fight off those dark demons. 

Through countless battles and obstacles, shadow hunters are destined to bring the light back  to this mortal world.

EPIC BOSS FIGHT

Demon Hunter most exciting moments must be it's epic boss battle, in which the Hunters must defeat dark giant demons to collect their souls and advance to the darkest dungeon and the highest floor of the evil tower. 

Without a decent set of equipment and highly trained techniques, any player could easily get wrecked by those big bosses. 

However, the incredible feelings that players get from successfully overcoming those challenges will make it all worth it. 

Furthermore, those dark demon souls are the key to upgrade hundreds of  shadow equipment and weapons, turning them from just a common warrior sword to a legendary hero's blade that would be worshiped by  the generations to come.

ENDLESS CHALLENGES

Demon Hunter will have 4+ different PVE sections with multiple difficulty modes  and a PVP arena for players to explore and conquer.

“Adventure” is where players start the game with. It may not be the most challenging part,  but it is the most essential section in the game since you need to keep advancing through it to unlock further sections of  the game.

Once you have passed a certain dungeon level, you can unlock  “Altar of the Darkness” , “Boss Mode” and “Clock Tower of Challenges”. Those are where the true test of skill and power happens. For our shadow hunters to overcome those challenges, mastering the fighting technique is a must, understanding the characteristics of each demon and preparing a suitable strategy is needed and strengthening the shadow equipment is a huge plus. 



At the end of the day, shadow hunters can not only liberate the mortal world from those dark demons but also can test their skills and mastery against other fellows of the shadow. 

MULTIPLE CHARACTERS TO PLAY AND ROLL

Eternium,com.makingfun.mageandminions,"Eternium is a beautifully crafted Action RPG, reminiscent of the great classics.

Eternium is unique among mobile Action RPGs with its effortless “tap to move” and innovative “swipe to cast” controls, and its player-friendly “no paywalls, never pay to win” philosophy.

With the exception of a couple of online-only features, the game can also be played offline after the content download completes.

Drawing signs to cast spells is easy and rewarding. The tap-to-move control is more natural and relaxing than thumbsticks, and it’s also truer to the vintage point-and-click ARPG experience.

The game can be really played for free, as more than 90% of our players do. Purchases are completely optional. Gems, the game’s main currency, can be collected from enemies and quests. There is no limiting stamina or energy. The best things in the game are obtained by playing, not paying.

Enjoy the visceral satisfaction of responsive, fast-paced combat, with spectacular special effects, pleasing sounds, rewarding damage numbers, all set against immersive backdrops and atmospheric, inspiring music scores.

Play as a Mage, Warrior or Bounty Hunter, wielding a sword, axe, staff or gun. Level up to learn new abilities and increase your attributes.

Battle skeletons, zombies, automatons, aliens, demons, dragons and many other creatures, across four beautifully hand-crafted worlds, or in endless generated levels.

Venture into dark caves and dungeons, explore forests, villages and graveyards, lay siege to demon controlled castles, brave snowy mountain peaks, travel to the moon to slay strange creatures among craters and canyons, and beyond, to the deserts, pyramids and jungles of the red planet.

Open treasure chests to loot gold, gemstones and battle gear. Equip shiny breastplates, menacing helmets and hoods, spiked shoulder pads, mysterious cloaks or capes. Protect yourself with a shield, or choose to wield two weapons as a warrior.

Rescue your tank, healer and ranger companions who will join you in battle. Use their abilities together with yours to create rewarding and powerful tactical combos.

Experience a refreshing storyline, filled with interplanetary intrigue and seasoned with funny characters. Hunt your arch-enemy, Ragadam, across the worlds, while trying to uncover and undo his twisted plans.

Progress from common to rare, epic and legendary gear. Find gemstones that fit in your armor’s sockets. Craft socketed rings and amulets, and fuse three of them into a higher quality one.

Unleash awesome offensive abilities, such as Whirlwind, Shockwave, Arc Lightning or Blizzard, control the enemy crowd with Frost Nova, Vortex, Silence, or sneak and assassinate with Smokescreen, Traps and Snipe.

Each hero class has access to about 20 abilities (skills or spells), and each of your three companions has four more. The game starts simple, but culminates in a flurry of tactical possibilities at high levels.

Once your hero reaches level 70, your experience points go into Champion Levels, which are unlimited and yield steady stat upgrades. Champion Levels are also inherited by your new heroes, so they will have an easier time growing up.

Aside from the four story acts, an endless progression of beautiful, randomly generated levels awaits in the Trials of Valor game mode.

Eternium is crafted with passion by a small band of old-school ARPG fans, who love making the game they always wanted to play.",https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/9q9O7xel239twqlmuteWPjko4zkLEqjgHYd1mMiVtHa9euBT9B8sgIo5iI5QkJflsg,Role Playing,4.781119,"10,000,000+"
